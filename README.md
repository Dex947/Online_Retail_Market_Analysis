## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Conda or Miniconda (recommended)
- Internet connection for dataset download

### Easy Setup (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dex947/Online_Retail_Market_Analysis.git
   cd Online-Retail-Market-Analysis
   ```

2. **Create conda environment**
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate online_retail_analysis
   ```

3. **Run automated setup**
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Create all necessary directories
   - Check for required packages
   - Download the dataset (optional)
   - Run the analysis automatically

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
